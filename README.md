# Wheel of Names

This is a simple, modern, and responsive web application that allows you to create a wheel of names, spin it, and randomly select a winner. The application is contained within a single HTML file, making it easy to deploy and use.

## Features

*   **Add/Remove Names:** Easily add new names to the wheel or remove existing ones.
*   **Random Spin:** Animate a random spin of the wheel to select a winner.
*   **Confetti Celebration:** When a winner is selected, a confetti animation celebrates the result.
*   **Winner Overlay:** The winner's name is displayed in a clear overlay on the wheel, which can be dismissed.
*   **Remove Winner Option:** An optional checkbox allows you to remove the selected winner from the wheel, preventing them from being picked again in subsequent spins.

## How to Use

1.  **Download the `index.html` file:** Ensure you have the `index.html` file on your computer.
2.  **Open in a Web Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file with any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

## Getting Started

1.  **Add Names:** Type a name into the "Enter a name" input field and click the "Add Name" button (or press Enter). The name will appear in the list below and on the wheel.
2.  **Remove Names:** To remove a name from the list, click the "×" button next to the name in the list.
3.  **Spin the Wheel:** Click the "Spin!" button to start the wheel spinning.
4.  **View Winner:** Once the wheel stops, the winner's name will appear in an overlay. Click the "×" button on the overlay to dismiss it.
